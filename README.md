# Loan Approval Analysis - Python


**Data Cleaning & Analysis** - JupyterLab

**Data Visualization** - JupyterLab

## Questions

Data Preprocessing: We'll start by gathering real-world loan data and getting it ready for analysis. 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We'll employ Python's powerful data visualization libraries to gain insights into the dataset. 

Feature Selection: We'll identify which features (such as credit score, income, loan amount, etc.) have the most significant impact on loan approval decisions.

Machine Learning Models: To make our analysis even more insightful, we'll build and train machine learning models to predict loan approval outcomes based on historical data.
